Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration 

Basic workflow and execution of project Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization (2018-2022)

live geo visualization dashboard with information displayed about Phonepe pulse with interactive and appealing manner with 10 different dropdown which user can select facts to display and data will be stored in MySQL database for efficient retrieval of data and dashboard will be dynamically updated the latest data   

Installation

To use this app, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system, as well as the following Python packages: 
• streamlit 
• pandas 
• mysql-connector-python
• plotly 

Step 1 
# GitHub cloning repository

open the repository in GitHub which you need to clone it 
click on code dropdown and select https 
copy the link given at https section 

# Create new folder to store the repository

create the folder where you need to store the github repository and open the folder
right click on mouse then select Git Bash here 
then type git clone in that application 
it will start downloading the repository which you need as local repository
after downloading you can work on it without changing in main original repository


Step 2 
# Tranforming the data into suitable formate 

Import all required lib like pandas,json,os,openpyxl 

give the path of state to get agg_state list 
open the path as listdir 

convert the data into dataframe
give the column name as empty list 
by for loop extract the data and append to the list and create dataframe 

convert the dataframe to csv with path name 

follow the same process for all data extractions for state user , user device , map details 

Step 3
# Database insert in mysql 
Import all required lib like pandas , mysql.connector , mysql.connector error 

reading of csv files 
read the csv file and print the head for your referance to verify it 

connection to mysql
connect to mysql with host, user, password, auth_plugin 

creating new database 
create the database by using cursor 

Create table and insert data 
connect to mysql by host, user, password, auth_plugin details 
create cursor and select the database with was created before 
if connected successfully then show to user in terminal as you are connected to database 
check of table name is exist if not create table with following name and datatypes 
after complete show user that table as been create 
insert the data into table by insert database name.table name and insert all value 
if all successfully insert the show user that record inserted if not show error as Error while connecting to mysql 

follow the same process for all data insert table for state user , user device , map details , distict latitude, longitude , state table 

Step 4 & 5 
# Streamlit dashbord creation and mysql data extraction 

Import all required lib like pandas , mysql.connector , streamlit , plotly.express 

connection to mysql
connect to mysql with host, user, password, auth_plugin 

Fetch the datas from mysql database 
use query and select table 
create df and read datas by pandas.read_sql

do same process for all the table 

Data rreparation for geo-india map 
sort the state values and reset the index 
create new df and groupby state and sum all transaction count , amount 

create choropleth data for state visualization 

list out all the state name and merge the state , district  by outer join 

first to show registered user and app installed details by selection year and state then scatter plot update the data from mysql and shows it 

Create 4 tabs for Geographical analysis, User device analysis, Payment Types analysis, Transacion analysis of States.

Geographical analysis
by selection year and quater the India map should update the data from mysql and shows the details about District name , Transaction count , Latitude & Longitude , State name , Transaction amount by color mark , Year and Quater 

User device analysis
by selection state , year and quater user tree map , bar should update with data from mysql and shows the details of state name , Label (user device) , Brand precentage , parent , id , year , quater , and brand count 

Payment Types analysis 
by selection state , year and quater , transcation count or amount bar should update with data from mysql and shows the details in bar and pie chart as transcation type , transaction count or amount , year 

Transacion analysis of States
by selection state , year and quater , transcation count or amount , transaction type  bar should update with data from mysql and shows the details in bar as year , transaction count or amount value and color mark

Step 6 
Deploy Steamlit app 
Upload all py file and csv to github 
run local py file as steamlit run project2_main1.py 
streamlit will open at right corner click on 3 dots and click on app deploy 
it will asked to login with git hub login 
click on new app 
give the details of your repo and branch and main py detail and click on deploy 
App will deploy and run 

changes to be done before deploy 
in github repo 
create new txt file as requirements.txt and enter below lines 
plotly==5.13.0
pandas==1.4.3
mysql-connector-python==8.0.32

in github repo 
main.py file following changes to be done 
it cant read the local file so click on csv folder and csv file 
click on raw at right side top option then csv details open in new tab 
copy the link from new tab and paate in read_csv path 
do same for all csv file
